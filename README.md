This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques to automatically identify and classify different types of waste materials. The dataset is organized into multiple sub-categories such as plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic waste, and other recyclable or non-recyclable materials.
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are highly effective for image-based tasks. The network learns important visual features like shape, texture, color, and edges directly from images, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.
The goal of this project is to support smart waste management and recycling systems by improving the accuracy and efficiency of waste sorting. Automated waste classification can help reduce human effort, minimize sorting errors, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
